Step1: created a new directory in my home folder named: Exercises

Step 2: changed to the Exercises directory
	performed git init

Step 3: checking for existing SSH key 
	added the key to ssh-agent
	added key to github account: gedit ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
	coppied the content of the file to GitHub settings --> SSH and GPG keys (but it already existed)

Step 4: tested the connection: ssh -T git@github.com

Step 5: on GitHub I created a new repository and named it BIT04_Exercises, added a README file

Step 6: cloned the repository to my local computer: git clone coppied the webadress from github and provided the directory Exercises 

Step 7: I created this file
